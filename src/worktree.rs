//! Thin wrapper around `flare_git_core::worktree` — the local git/worktree

//! deliberately does NOT know about: the main binary's MCP-specific
//! `ProgressSender` (depends on `rmcp`), and opening a GitHub PR once a
//! branch is pushed (depends on `src/github`, a GitHub-REST concern kept
//! out of flare-git-core on purpose).
